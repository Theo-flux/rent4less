# Rent4less Realtor Project.

Rent4less is a dummy project built using nextjs, sanity, typescript and tailwindcss. spoiler alert, my first time using these tech stacks. lol.

## Getting Started

### Tools used:

- Next.Js - Next.js is an open-source web development framework built on top of Node.js enabling React based web applications functionalities such as server-side rendering and generating static websites.

- Typescript - TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. It is designed for the development of large applications and transpiles to JavaScript.

- Sanity - Sanity.io is the unified content platform that powers better digital experiences. Basically for content management.

- Tailwindcss - Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.
